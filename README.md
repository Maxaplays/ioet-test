# Ioet-Exercise

## Requirments

- Python installed (Using Python 3.9.0)
  - Optional Code Editor to explore the code (Using VS Code)
  - Optional pytest Library to check on Unit Tests

## Explination

- The objective of this exercise is to determine how many times employees schedules have been aligned and print them out in the console.
- Taking the information from a .txt file and writing the code without any external libraries or libraries that require import included in Python, ex: "datetime"
- An exeption to this rule is libreries included for Unit Testing purpuses.

## Run

1. Use the git clone command to clone the repository.
2. Access the cloned folder using the console.
3. Assuming the computer has python installed, run the following command:
   `python main.py`

## Edit

To change the employee schedules, try editing the "MockData.txt" file to try different results.

## Testing

- For testing, make use of the code editor for accesibility, in this case VS Code.
- Go to the project and select the "Testing" tab on the left to see and run the tests.
- Make sure to use the pytest library when running the tests.
- All the tests are grouped up in the "tests" folder.
